_An attachment for the [Ender 3](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-3d-printer) 3D Printer that allows for 2D Plotter functionality. This project was intended to allow for printing onto non-standard materials/objects. Included are the designs for the following:_


### Plotter

A spring loaded fixture to designed to hold a pen in place on the Ender 3 X-Carriage. Can be used with any writing utensil (up to 15mm diameter) and other tools (e.g., scribers, engravers, etc.)

### Cassette Tape Fixture
 A simple fixture to allow one to print directly onto a cassette tape. This was intended as a cheaper alternative to pad printing, with a better finish than printout tape labels. For best results, use an oil ink based pen for printing to prevent smearing.

## Getting Started

### Design Files
This repo contains design files for the main Plotter assembly and the Cassette Tape Fixture. The plotter was designed to be compatible with the Ender 3 X carriage. You can 3D print the STL files without the need for supports using your preferred slicer settings. There are also design templates included for use with the cassette fixture.

### PrusaSlicer Settings
The PrusaSlicer settings profile I use to generate the plotter GCode is included. PrusaSlicer is a free slicer available [here](https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/). You can learn how to import profile settings [here](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-import-and-export-custom-profiles-in-prusaslicer_382766). The input into PrusaSlicer will be the SVG file formats of your design.

### Instructions
Contains PDFs with instructions on how to assemble, install, and use the plotter. Also includes a disassembly guide on how to remove the existing hotend on the Ender 3 printer.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
### Tools
The following tools are needed to build the F.S. Plotter and Cassette Fixture:
*  Ender 3 3D Printer
*  Hex Drivers
*  M2, M3, M4 Thread Taps
*  Computer capable of running PrusaSlicer

### Materials
The following materials are needed to build the F.S. Plotter and Cassette Fixture 
_(Note the springs and screws are purchased in a kit but only specific ones are needed. See assembly instructions for details)_:
*  PLA to print the parts
*  [40mm Linear Rail](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832805844953.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.454c180283Jvim&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa)
* [Metric Screw Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K141VFD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Extension Spring Kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFRF42LQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)
* [Compression Spring Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Dianrui-Compression-Assortment-Mechanical-K-P-051-300/dp/B0BVTDP29W/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.oENvzNEO-WFAaDM5gwW5XARYotBUET6vC5KYUWX5-t2AzaaVu_9kmDe4dv1sqKpHo4ty6gVKh9PSDaPQ6a6FalDLMrhdeUUzLaSkXZtUO4JKRjMZNQTryWCaEWkOGMyxdTM6avatdjzTBRnKIEJOCyqHJuk1tU_i0R0pHoVnNHaUKih1k1vct712QprWotIrIkaRxe-RTSLSec3pYUGvbdH1mEMHFwfF0HeM-n8UW90.MJGj1d6DOn0h5zKlIwrh6RFbQRCkAim5IoaBg9l5MMc&dib_tag=se&keywords=Compression+Spring+Kit&qid=1708984110&sr=8-1)

If individual parts are purchased separately (via Aliexpress), both assemblies can be built for around $30!
