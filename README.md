# _F.S. PLOTTER_
**By: Geoffrey Gao**

_An attachment for the Ender 3 3D Printer that allows for 2D Plotter functionality. This project was intended to allow for 2D printing onto non-standard materials/objects. This repository also includes a fixture to allow for printing directly onto cassette tapes, and basic settings for PrusaSlicer for plotting._


## Getting Started

### 3D Files
_This repo contains .STL files for the main F.S. Plotter assembly and the Cassette Tape Mounting Fixture. The mount was designed to be compatible with the Ender 3 X carriage. You can 3D print these files without the need for supports using your preferred slicer settings._
### PrusaSlicer Settings
_The PrusaSlicer settings I use to generate the plotter GCode is included. PrusaSlicer is a free slicer available here. The input into PrusaSlicer will be the SVG file formats of your choice.._


## Setup/Installation Requirements
### Tools
_The following tools are needed to build the F.S. Plotter._
*  _Ender 3 3D Printer_
*  _Hex Drivers_
*  _M2, M3, M4 Thread Taps_
*  _Computer capable of running PrusaSlicer_

### Materials
_The following materials are needed to build the F.S. Plotter. Note the springs and screws are purchased in a kit but only specific ones are needed. See assembly instructions for details_
*  _PLA to print the plotter/fixtures_
*  _[40mm Linear Rail](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832805844953.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.454c180283Jvim&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa)_
