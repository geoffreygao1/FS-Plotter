# _F.S. PLOTTER_
**By: Geoffrey Gao**

_An attachment for the Ender 3 3D Printer that allows for 2D Plotter functionality. This project was intended to allow for 2D printing onto non-standard materials/objects._

## Getting Started

### 3D Files
This repo contains STL files for the main F.S. Plotter assembly and the Cassette Tape Mounting Fixture. The plotter was designed to be compatible with the Ender 3 X carriage. You can 3D print these files without the need for supports using your preferred slicer settings.

### PrusaSlicer Settings
The PrusaSlicer settings profile I use to generate the plotter GCode is included. PrusaSlicer is a free slicer available [here](https://www.prusa3d.com/en/page/prusaslicer_424/). You can learn how to import profile settings [here](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/how-to-import-and-export-custom-profiles-in-prusaslicer_382766). The input into PrusaSlicer will be the SVG file formats of your design.

### Instructions
Contains PDFs with instructions on how to assemble, install, and use the plotter. Also includes a disassembly guide on how to remove the existing hotend on the Ender 3 printer.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
### Tools
The following tools are needed to build the F.S. Plotter:
*  Ender 3 3D Printer
*  Hex Drivers
*  M2, M3, M4 Thread Taps
*  Computer capable of running PrusaSlicer

### Materials
The following materials are needed to build the F.S. Plotter _(Note the springs and screws are purchased in a kit but only specific ones are needed. See assembly instructions for details)_:
*  PLA to print the parts
*  [40mm Linear Rail](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832805844953.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.454c180283Jvim&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa)
* [Metric Screw Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K141VFD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Extension Spring Kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFRF42LQ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)
* [Compression Spring Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Dianrui-Compression-Assortment-Mechanical-K-P-051-300/dp/B0BVTDP29W/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.oENvzNEO-WFAaDM5gwW5XARYotBUET6vC5KYUWX5-t2AzaaVu_9kmDe4dv1sqKpHo4ty6gVKh9PSDaPQ6a6FalDLMrhdeUUzLaSkXZtUO4JKRjMZNQTryWCaEWkOGMyxdTM6avatdjzTBRnKIEJOCyqHJuk1tU_i0R0pHoVnNHaUKih1k1vct712QprWotIrIkaRxe-RTSLSec3pYUGvbdH1mEMHFwfF0HeM-n8UW90.MJGj1d6DOn0h5zKlIwrh6RFbQRCkAim5IoaBg9l5MMc&dib_tag=se&keywords=Compression+Spring+Kit&qid=1708984110&sr=8-1)


## Assembly/Usage Instructions
_Please see the PDFs included in the [Instructions Folder](https://github.com/geoffreygao1/Plotter/tree/main/Instructions) for assembly and usage instructions_

## Cassette Tape Fixture
I have also designed a fixture to allow one to print directly onto a cassette tape. This was intended as a cheaper alternative to pad printing, with a better finish than printout tape labels.  
  
For best results, use an oil ink based pen for printing to prevent smearing. I prefer the [Sharpie Extra-fine Tip Paint Markers](https://www.sharpie.com/markers/chalk-paint-markers/sharpie-oil-based-paint-marker-extra-fine-point/SAP_1874990.html), but have been constantly testing out new pens to get better results.

This is still a work in progress so please check regularly for updates! Special thanks to Jake C. for allowing me to borrow his Ender 3!
